# Extension Icons

Placeholder for extension icons. You'll need to add:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These can be generated using any icon generator or design tool. Recommended: simple HubSpot-themed logo with "AI" or "Breeze" branding.

For quick testing, you can use https://www.iconarchive.com or create simple colored squares as placeholders.
